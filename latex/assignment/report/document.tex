\subsection{Studies}
\subsubsection{a) What goals were you able to achieve this semester?}

Over the course of this semester, I was able to achieve several important goals. As someone with a background in business administration, I initially felt a bit intimidated by the technical aspects of my master's program in computer science. However, I was determined to put in the hard work necessary to succeed, and I'm proud to say that I was able to pass all of my courses with good grades. 

In addition to meeting my academic goals, I also succeeded in deepening my understanding of various aspects of computer science. As a result, I feel much more confident in my ability to tackle complex technical challenges in the future. 

\subsubsection{b) What challenged you the most?}
The course of Advanced Software and Systems Engineering was extremely challenging, and I struggled to keep up with some of the new concepts presented, despite the professor's suggestion that we should have learned them during our undergraduate studies. However, I was determined to persevere and was able to fill in gaps in my knowledge by working with my colleagues through pair programming exercises and dedicating extra time to studying the material. Ultimately, I'm proud to say that I was able to overcome these obstacles and succeed in the course.

\subsection{Mentoring Relationship}
\subsubsection{a) What was your mentor particularly able to support you in?}

Throughout my mentoring experience, my mentor provided me with invaluable support in a variety of ways. One area where he was particularly helpful was in helping me to clarify my career goals. During our initial meeting, he asked me to think about what I really wanted out of a career in the field of computer science. While I had given this some thought before, his questions and insights helped me to explore this topic in much greater depth.

One thing that was particularly helpful was when he recommended a book called "9 Lies About Work". This book challenged me to think not only about the specific domain area I want to work in, but also about the work culture and type of employment that would be best suited to my personal preferences and strengths. This was a valuable exercise that helped me to gain greater clarity about my long-term career goals. Altogether, I feel very fortunate to have a mentor to guide and support me during my master's program.

\subsubsection{b) What could you learn from the personal experiences of your mentor?}
One of the things that I appreciated most about my mentoring experience was the opportunity to learn from my mentor's personal experiences. One topic that we discussed in depth was personal finances. During our conversations, my mentor shared with me his own experiences with saving and investing, and provided me with valuable insights into how I could improve my own financial situation.

One thing that particularly stuck with me was his emphasis on the importance of the savings rate. He explained that the savings rate is a crucial factor in achieving financial freedom and independence. This really motivated me to take a closer look at my own finances and to start taking steps to increase my savings rate. To help me in this process, my mentor even sent me a link to a savings rate calculator. This tool allowed me to see how different levels of saving could impact my long-term financial goals, which was very inspiring. 

\subsubsection{c) What topics would you like to discuss in the future?}
One area that I would like to focus on is how I can improve my position within my future employment. My mentor has already been incredibly helpful in providing me with guidance on how to write an effective resume, and I'm excited to continue working with him to refine this important skill.

In addition to this, I would also like to discuss strategies for adding value in my future job roles, and how I can effectively communicate my ideas and desires to my employers. As someone who is just starting out in the field of computer science, I know that there is still much for me to learn in terms of navigating the job market and advancing my career. However, I feel confident that with the guidance and support of my mentor, I will be well-equipped to succeed in whatever career path I choose to pursue.


\subsection{Outlook}
\subsubsection{a) What is your focus for the upcoming semester?}
In the upcoming semester, I plan to deepen my knowledge of data science through courses that cover topics like machine learning and natural language processing. As someone interested in computer science, I recognize the importance of a strong foundation in data science for many industries, and I'm excited to position myself for success in my future career by building up my skills and knowledge in this area.

\subsubsection{b) What makes you happy and what will you do to achieve it?}
One of the things that brings me the most happiness is learning new things. I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and skills, and I'm excited about the opportunities for on-the-job learning that I hope to encounter in my future profession. In addition to this, I also enjoy pursuing my interests through side projects and personal learning initiatives. I find that keeping track of my progress and taking detailed notes helps me to solidify my understanding of complex topics and persist this knowledge over time.

Looking ahead, I'm committed to continuing my journey of lifelong learning, both in my academic pursuits and in my future career. I'm confident that by maintaining a growth mindset and being open to new challenges and opportunities, I will be able to achieve my goals and find happiness and fulfillment in whatever path I choose to pursue.
