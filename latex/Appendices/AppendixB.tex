Chapter \ref{2.1} mentioned key characteristics of cyber currencies. The following direct relationships between these characteristics and national security have been identified:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Anonymity and untraceability:} One of the key characteristics of cyber currencies is their ability to provide anonymous and untraceable transactions. This feature can make it difficult for law enforcement to track and prosecute crimes involving these technologies, and can have implications for national security.
    \item \textbf{Decentralization:} Cyber currencies are decentralized, meaning that they are not controlled by a central authority such as a bank or government. This can provide benefits in terms of security and reliability, but can also make it more difficult to regulate and monitor these technologies.
    \item \textbf{Lack of regulation:} In many cases, cyber currencies are not subject to the same regulations and oversight as traditional financial systems. This can raise concerns about the potential for illicit use and abuse of these technologies, and may lead to increased regulation in the future.
\end{itemize}
