Cyber currencies have attracted the attention of cybercriminals as a means of payment and exchange due to their anonymity and decentralized nature, leading to their use in a variety of illicit activities such as money laundering, ransomware attacks, and drug trafficking. State actors have responded to this issue by implementing a variety of measures, including regulatory frameworks, to track and trace transactions and ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations. The purpose of this thesis is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of affairs as well as potential future developments related to the role of cyber currencies in cybercrime. Through a review of the literature and analysis of relevant case studies, this research aims to examine the ways in which cyber currencies are used in illicit activities and the measures taken by state actors to address this issue.  This study's findings have important implications for the development of cyber currencies and their potential integration into mainstream financial systems.
