	abstract = {Bitcoin is the most widely used cryptocurrency for illegal trade in current darknet markets. Owing to the anonymity of its addresses, even though transaction flows are globally visible, Bitcoin clustering remains one of the most challenging and open problems in illegal Bitcoin transaction analysis. In this article, to resolve this problem, we propose a novel multi-layer heuristic algorithm for Bitcoin clustering, which leverages on-chain transactions as well as off-chain application data in the real world. For this purpose, we first explored the unique characteristics of darknet market ecosystems including their trading systems. By conducting an in-depth analysis of the data manually collected for 11 months, we found that some darknet market review data disclosed transactions containing Bitcoin value and item delivery information. We then identified unique Bitcoin addresses associated with the disclosed information, owned by the same darknet providers. Based on address ownership, more accurate market clusters could be created, which have not previously been identified by other clustering algorithms. According to our experimental results, approximately 31.68\% of the darknet market review data matched real Bitcoin transactions, and 122 hidden clusters associated with Silk Road 4 were found. This indicates that the proposed algorithm can complement existing clustering methods and significantly reduce the false negative rate by up to 91.7\%.},

Kim’s early prioritization of the byungjin policy, simultaneous economic and military or nuclear development, highlighted his goal of transforming North Korea’s domestic economic circumstances and strengthening its position in the world as a nuclear state. The central dilemma shaping Kim Jong-un’s foreign policy throughout his first decade in power revolves around ensuring North Korea’s prosperity and security while sustaining the political isolation and control necessary for regime survival. In order to evaluate North Korea’s foreign policy under Kim, this volume will examine the impact of domestic factors that have influenced the formation and implementation of Kim’s foreign policy, Kim’s distinctive use of summitry and effectiveness of such meetings as an instrument by which to attain foreign policy goals, and the impact of international responses to North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear capabilities on North Korea’s foreign policy.},

Additionally, this form of malware is incorporating advanced encryption algorithms and expanding the number of file types it targets. Cybercriminals have found a lucrative market and no one is safe from being the next victim. Encrypting ransomware targets business small and large as well as the regular home user.

	shorttitle = {'Silk Road', the virtual drug marketplace},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The online promotion of 'drug shopping' and user information networks is of increasing public health and law enforcement concern. An online drug marketplace called 'Silk Road' has been operating on the 'Deep Web' since February 2011 and was designed to revolutionise contemporary drug consumerism.
{METHODS}: A single case study approach explored a 'Silk Road' user's motives for online drug purchasing, experiences of accessing and using the website, drug information sourcing, decision making and purchasing, outcomes and settings for use, and perspectives around security. The participant was recruited following a lengthy relationship building phase on the 'Silk Road' chat forum.
{RESULTS}: The male participant described his motives, experiences of purchasing processes and drugs used from 'Silk Road'. Consumer experiences on 'Silk Road' were described as 'euphoric' due to the wide choice of drugs available, relatively easy once navigating the Tor Browser (encryption software) and using 'Bitcoins' for transactions, and perceived as safer than negotiating illicit drug markets. Online researching of drug outcomes, particularly for new psychoactive substances was reported. Relationships between vendors and consumers were described as based on cyber levels of trust and professionalism, and supported by 'stealth modes', user feedback and resolution modes. The reality of his drug use was described as covert and solitary with psychonautic characteristics, which contrasted with his membership, participation and feelings of safety within the 'Silk Road' community.
{CONCLUSION}: 'Silk Road' as online drug marketplace presents an interesting displacement away from 'traditional' online and street sources of drug supply. Member support and harm reduction ethos within this virtual community maximises consumer decision-making and positive drug experiences, and minimises potential harms and consumer perceived risks. Future research is necessary to explore experiences and backgrounds of other users.},

	abstract = {Performing a fair exchange without a Trusted Third Party ({TTP}) was considered to be impossible. With multi party computation and practices like Proof-of-Work ({PoW}), blockchain accomplishes a fair exchange in a trustless network. Data confidentiality is a key challenge that has to be resolved before adopting blockchain for enterprise applications where tokenized assets will be transferred. Protocols like Zcash are already providing the same for financial transactions but lacks flexibility required to apply in most of the potential use cases of blockchain. Most of the real world application work in a way where a transaction is carried out when a particular action is performed. Also, the zero knowledge proof method used in Zcash, {ZKSNARK} has certain weaknesses restricting its adoption. One of the major drawbacks of {ZKSNARK} is that it requires an initial trust setup phase which is difficult to achieve in blockchain ecosystem. {ZKSTARK}, an interactive zero knowledge proof does not require this phase and also provides security against post quantum attacks. We propose a system that uses two indistinguishable hash functions along with {ZKSTARK} to improve the flexibility of blockchain platforms. The two indistinguishable hash functions are chosen from {SHA}3-finalists based on their security, performance and inner designs.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of {CPU} power. As long as a majority of {CPU} power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

Design/methodology/approach This study investigated the antecedents of a blockchain cryptocurrency adoption framework by adapting well-established items from the information systems ({IS}) and psychology literature to produce a survey instrument to measure individuals’ intention to engage in blockchain cryptocurrency transactions. The survey was administered to 492 individuals through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Findings This study resulted in a research model of an individual’s intention to transact with a blockchain cryptocurrency. Results indicated that the expanded {TPB} model explains 63.5\% of the variance in intention to adopt cryptocurrency for transactional usage. In this study, all paths leading to behavioral intention were found to be significant in the hypothesized directions. In addition, all paths leading to attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control were found to be significant in the hypothesized directions. Originality/value This study furthers prior literature by empirically validating the expanded {TPB} in the context of individuals’ intention to use cryptocurrency for transactional purposes. This study can better inform practitioners on individual attitudes and behaviors toward transactional cryptocurrency use. The findings provide regulators meaningful insights toward the development of a regulatory framework which encourages innovation while safeguarding the interests of individual citizens.},

They are challenged to provide an adequate response, protect investors and customers, and mitigate risks while fostering technological development. Currently, at the {EU}-wide level, there is a regulatory gap, which contributes to legal uncertainty and weak investor protection. Several European jurisdictions have been proactive and successfully designed their own national regulatory solutions to crypto assets. Many European and international supervisory and regulatory bodies contributed to the debate and issued reports, analysis and statements highlighting risks and making regulatory recommendations. The European Commission took the first steps to assume its competence over all crypto assets within the {EU} and, after a comprehensive review of the entire crypto assets ecosystem, issued a proposal for a regulation on markets in crypto assets. This paper evaluates the {EU}'s current regulatory approach to crypto assets against the background of the views and reports of several advisory and supervisory bodies and international organizations and against market developments.},

	shorttitle = {The economic potential and risks of crypto assets},
	abstract = {We analyse and assess the economic potential and risk of crypto assets and discuss key regulatory questions that European Union policymakers need to confront. Crypto assets can be broadly classified as cryptocurrencies - a private means of payment - and initial coin offerings ({ICOs}), typically used to fund new activities against the promise of future utilities (utility tokens) or financial returns (securities tokens). Crypto exchanges and wallets provide services such as exchanging crypto assets into central bank currencies and brokerage services. The underlying technologies - record keeping in distributed ledgers and blockchain - facilitate peer-to-peer interactions without intermediaries and are still experimental. They have been praised as offering benefits for many applications beyond finance, but there is also significant scepticism. The crypto asset market has seen huge variation in its market valuation. After a peak of above \$ 800 billion (January 2018), it fell to around {US} \$ 200 billion (August 2018). Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have dropped markedly in value. The amount of funds raised through {ICOs} has also declined substantially since its March 2018 peak. Regulators and supervisors have taken great interest in these new markets. Different regulators in Europe classify and treat cryptocurrencies differently. Some classify cryptocurrency as a unit of account while others reject it as a financial instrument. Several regulators take the view that case-by-case assessments of {ICOs} are necessary. There seems to be convergence on the view that crypto exchanges and wallet providers should require authorisation to operate. Crypto assets raise six major public policy questions: how great is the potential of crypto assets in advanced financial systems? What is the best way to combat illegal activity such as money laundering and terrorism finance? How can consumer and investor protection be ensured? What about financial stability? How might crypto assets be taxed? And how can blockchain applications be embedded into the existing legal framework? European policymakers must first decide whether crypto assets should be isolated, regulated or integrated. We argue that at this point regulation is the right approach. Second, global cooperation in the managing risks of the new technology should be ensured while reaping the opportunities it undoubtedly provides. The G20 and the Financial Stability Board should set regulatory norms that address the six policy questions. Standard-setting organisations such as the International Organisation for Standardization should also play a role. Third, {EU} policymakers need to agree on the right moment to move supervision of crypto assets from the national level to the {EU} level. In a single market for capital, diverging supervisory practices can come with significant downsides and this is particularly true for highly mobile crypto assets. However, different supervisory practices can allow experimentation with different approaches to a fast-changing technology.},

Obtaining content of the deep web is challenging and has been acknowledged as a significant gap in the coverage of search engines. The paper proposes a novel deep web crawling framework based on reinforcement learning, in which the crawler is regarded as an agent and deep web database as the environment. The agent perceives its current state and selects an action (query) to submit to the environment (the deep web database) according to Q-value. While the existing methods rely on an assumption that all deep web databases possess full-text search interfaces and solely utilize the statistics ({TF} or {DF}) of acquired data records to generate the next query, the reinforcement learning framework not only enables crawlers to learn a promising crawling strategy from its own experience, but also allows for utilizing diverse features of query keywords. Experimental results show that the method outperforms the state of art methods in terms of crawling capability and relaxes the assumption of full-text search implied by existing methods.},

This article explores these from the role of Russian-Venezuelan corruption as a versatile amalgam within the alliance from 2005 to 2018. Based on a descriptive research design, the systematization of scattered information, and the application of a congruence method, we infer that corruption contributes to improving Russian-Venezuelan political cohesion. Our inference indicates that these ties, in addition to serving Russian-Venezuelan geopolitical interests regarding the United States, constitute a cycle in which political corruption strengthens the alliance, favouring special corporate interests, undermining rule of law, encouraging corruption, and revitalizing authoritarianism in Venezuela. Las relaciones entre Rusia y Venezuela son las más controvertidas entre los estados latino-americanos y las potencias extrarregionales, debido a la naturaleza técnico-militar de sus vínculos originales, sus implicaciones para la rivalidad ruso-estadounidense, y sobre la seguridad hemisférica y la democracia.

The authors link the regulatory dialectic paradigm to know your customer and anti-money laundering evasion techniques, highlight six tactics to launder funds with virtual assets and investigate potential law enforcement and regulatory alternates used to reduce the incidence of money laundering with digital coins. Design/methodology/approach The methodology used is the analysis of significant recent events and the availability of “fintech” crime-fighting tools and a literature review focusing on the application of the regulatory dialectic to innovations in existing crypto-asset markets that make them compelling to money launderers. Findings The authors examine the illicit use of cryptocurrency through Kane’s regulatory dialectic paradigm, identify a number of avenues for crypto to fiat exchange that are still available for those seeking to launder money using digital coins, review recently “closed doors” and make recommendations regarding the regulation of crypto-related markets that may assist in making them less desirable for potential criminals. Research limitations/implications The research is constrained by the state of the market for crypto to fiat exchange as of time of writing; the technology and products to launder money using these open doors is continually changing (as predicted by the regulatory dialectic). Social implications The regulatory dialectic predicts that regulatory response is reactive and often increasingly burdensome or oppressive. There is continuous innovation in the cryptocurrency market, which seeks to preserve privacy and anonymity with which regulators seek to keep up. From a social perspective, the response of bank regulators worldwide to existing open doors for crypto to fiat exchange used for money laundering may prove costly to individuals engaging in legitimate transactions, as well as financial criminals and may also erode the ability of individuals to maintain privacy regarding their financial information. Originality/value To the authors’ knowledge, there are yet no broad overview regarding the feasibility of money laundering across crypto-related assets within the paradigm of the regulatory dialectic.},

	shorttitle = {Evaluating drug trafficking on the Tor Network},
	abstract = {Background
Housing an illicit, online drug retail market generating sales in the millions of {USD}, the Silk Road was a profitable marketplace with a growing and loyal consumer base. Following its {FBI}-forced shut down in October 2013, the Silk Road enjoyed newfound fame that contributed to an increase in new users downloading and accessing the Tor Network; however, with this particular marketplace out of order, Silk Road 2 was launched to fill the void. The goals of this study were to (1) compare the metrics of Silk Road 2 to the original site, and to (2) determine if there were any indications of the presence of more sophisticated drug trafficking operations.
Methods
Data were collected from Silk Road 2 during the months of August and September 2014 using webcrawling software.
Results
Silk Road 2 was a much smaller marketplace than the original Silk Road. Of the 1834 unique items for sale, 348 were drug items sold by 145 distinct vendors shipping from 19 countries. Of the drug items advertised, most were stimulants and hallucinogens. The United States is both the number one country of origin for drug sales on Silk Road 2 and the number one destination country. Interestingly, 73\% of all vendor accounts on Silk Road 2 advertised drug items, even though drugs only constituted 19\% of all items advertised.
Conclusion
This study was the first to research Silk Road 2, the replacement illicit marketplace to the original virtual Silk Road. This study was also the first to examine indications of the presence of more coordinated drug trafficking efforts in an online setting. The findings indicated that while Silk Road 2 was not primarily a drug market, there were indications that some vendor accounts may have connections reaching beyond a base retail market.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to look at current discourse on the topic of crypto-currencies, more specifically Bitcoins, and their application to funding acts of terror. The paper clearly establishes the risks posed by this new payment technology and value transfer system to assist in the process of funding, planning and implementing acts of terror. Design/methodology/approach Publications, blogs and sites published and administered by terrorists groups and their supporters are examined to determine their interest in leveraging emerging payment and value transfer systems to facilitate the funding, planning and implementation of terror attacks. Press releases and other publications are also examined to determine whether crypto-currencies have been used by these groups in fund raising, fund transfer or recent terror attacks. Findings Although it is difficult to find concrete evidence of largescale use of Bitcoins and other crypto-currencies by terrorist groups and their supporters, there is strong evidence to suggest that they have been linked to a number of terror attacks in Europe and Indonesia. Supporters of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ({ISIS}), jihadists and terrorist organisations are actively looking to and promoting the use of new and emerging technologies, such as Bitcoin, to mitigate some of the risks associated with traditional fund transfer methods. Some websites associated with terrorist organisations have started to collect donations in Bitcoins. Many Bitcoin {ATMs} and Bitcoin exchanges are located in countries that have seen significant numbers of foreign fighters join {ISIS} in the Middle East and are also positioned in countries that have seen increased risk of terror attack. These present a significant risk because they allow for the seamless, anonymous transfer of funds to and from terrorist groups and their supporters. The paper highlights the need for further in-depth research into reliable ways to circumvent the current difficulties experienced in differentiating illicit transactions from legitimate ones and establishing reliable means of attribution. Originality/value Using a document published by {ISIS}, which provides would-be jihadists detailed instructions on how they can get to Syria or Iraq without being detected, a set of models were created showing how this could be achieved using Bitcoins alone. From this scenario, red flag indicators and suspicious behaviour models have been created to determine whether they can be identified during detailed analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain which will be conducted in later stages of research.},

One can describe the Internet as composed of layers: the “upper” layer, or the Surface Web, can easily be accessed by regular searches. However, “deeper” layers, the content of the Deep Web, have not been indexed by traditional search engines such as Google. Michael K. Bergman who wrote the seminal paper on the Deep Web, compared searching the Internet to dragging a net across the surface of the ocean: a great deal may be caught in the net, but there is a wealth of information that is deeper and therefore missed. In fact, most of the Web's information is buried far down on sites, and standard search engines are unable to access it.},

Most countries are wary of legalizing this payment instrument, fearing problems associated with tax evasion, terrorist financing, fraud and other illegal transactions. Nevertheless, the issue of legalization of cryptocurrencies has recently moved to a different level as the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to over {USD} 237 billion 2020, with several leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin skyrocketing in value in 2021. The explosive growth has been lead in no small part by China, the world’s largest and most important market for cryptocurrency in terms of mining, investing and research. This article reviews the current trends in cryptocurrency regulation with a particular focus on China, including an analysis of current cryptocurrency laws in China, as well as the new Chinese Cryptography Law.

Bitcoin utilizes a peer-to-peer network to issue anonymous payment transactions between different users. In the currently used Bitcoin clients, the full transaction history is available at each node of the network to prevent double spending without the need for a central authority, forming a valuable source for empirical research on network structure, network dynamics, and the implied anonymity challenges, as well as guidance on the future evolution of complex payment systems. We found dynamical effects of which some increase anonymity while others decrease it. Most importantly, several parameters of the Bitcoin transaction graph seem to have become stationary over the last 12–18 months. We discuss the implications.},

	abstract = {The internet era has generated a requirement for low cost, anonymous and rapidly verifiable transactions to be used for online barter, and fast settling money have emerged as a consequence. For the most part, e-money has fulfilled this role, but the last few years have seen two new types of money emerge. Centralised virtual currencies, usually for the purpose of transacting in social and gaming economies, and crypto-currencies, which aim to eliminate the need for financial intermediaries by offering direct peer-to-peer online payments. We describe the historical context which led to the development of these currencies and some modern and recent trends in their uptake, in terms of both usage in the real economy and as investment products. As these currencies are purely digital constructs, with no government or local authority backing, we then discuss them in the context of monetary theory, in order to determine how they may be have value under each. Finally, we provide an overview of the state of regulatory readiness in terms of dealing with transactions in these currencies in various regions of the world.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin is an online communication protocol that facilitates the use of a virtual currency, including electronic payments. Bitcoin's rules were designed by engineers with no apparent influence from lawyers or regulators. Bitcoin is built on a transaction log that is distributed across a network of participating computers. It includes mechanisms to reward honest participation, to bootstrap acceptance by early adopters, and to guard against concentrations of power. Bitcoin's design allows for irreversible transactions, a prescribed path of money creation over time, and a public transaction history. Anyone can create a Bitcoin account, without charge and without any centralized vetting procedure—or even a requirement to provide a real name. Collectively, these rules yield a system that is understood to be more flexible, more private, and less amenable to regulatory oversight than other forms of payment—though as we discuss, all these benefits face important limits. Bitcoin is of interest to economists as a virtual currency with potential to disrupt existing payment systems and perhaps even monetary systems. This article presents the platform's design principles and properties for a nontechnical audience; reviews its past, present, and future uses; and points out risks and regulatory issues as Bitcoin interacts with the conventional financial system and the real economy.},
